# Women's Safety Panic Button IoT System

This project implements an IoT-based panic button system using **ESP32** (or **ESP8266**), **GPS**, and **Wi-Fi** for sending emergency alerts. When the panic button is pressed, the system sends real-time location data to a cloud server.

## Features:
- Detect panic button press
- Retrieve GPS location data
- Send real-time data to ThingSpeak (or Firebase)
- Cloud-based tracking and alert system

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Womens-Safety-Panic-Button-IoT.git
   cd Womens-Safety-Panic-Button-IoT
